# Overview

The purpose of writing this software was to test my learning of Kotlin. I spent the last 2 weeks learning kotlin, with the intetion to grow in my abilities as a programmer.
This also helped broaden my horizon because this is my first time not using VS code.

This software is the beginnings of an old school Text Based RPG in the command line.

The purpose of writing a Text Based RPG is to practice my abilites in a language I knew nothing about 2 weeks ago. This had me practice using classes, functions, conditionals, and loops in Kotlin.
